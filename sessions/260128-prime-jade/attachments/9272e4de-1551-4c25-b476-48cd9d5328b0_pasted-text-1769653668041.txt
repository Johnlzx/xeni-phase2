As a Home Office caseworker reviewing applications for the government, I want documents to follow a clear, consistent naming convention so that I can immediately understand what a document is and who it relates to just by looking at the file name.

Detailed Description
User Need (Problem)
Immigration applications often contain many documents that look similar at a glance (e.g., multiple bank statements, payslips, letters). File names received directly from clients or third parties are inconsistent and often unhelpful.

Clear, standardised file names allow reviewers to quickly recognise documents without opening them, particularly when:

Reviewing applications
Downloading files or ZIP bundles
Preparing or checking submissions
Suggested Solution (Step-by-Step Behaviour)
1. Apply a Consistent Naming Convention
Xeni generates clear, structured document names using the standard pattern:

who_documentType_mostRecentDate

2. Clearly Identify Who the Document Relates To
The file name includes a short identifier indicating who the document relates to, such as:

applicant
sponsor
adviser
dependant (if applicable)
3. Clearly Identify the Document Type
The file name includes a recognisable document type, for example:

payslip
bankStatement
passport
letterOfConsent
employmentContract
proofOfCohabitation
proofOfAccommodation
4. Include a Date Only When Relevant
Time-based documents (e.g., bank statements, payslips):

Include the most recent relevant date in MMYY format
Example: 0126 for January 2026
Non time-based documents (e.g., passports, consent letters):

Omit the date portion entirely
5. Use the Same Convention Everywhere
The generated file name is used consistently across:

Document lists
Individual file downloads
ZIP exports
Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria – File Naming Convention
Naming Format

Given a document is uploaded or processed
When Xeni assigns a file name
Then the name follows the format who_documentType_mostRecentDate (where applicable)
Person Identification

Given a document relates to a specific person
When the file name is generated
Then the name clearly identifies who the document relates to (e.g., applicant, sponsor)
Document Type

Given a document has a recognisable type
When the file name is generated
Then the document type is clearly reflected in the name
Time-Based Documents

Given a document is time-based
When the file name is generated
Then the most recent relevant date is included in MMYY format
Non Time-Based Documents

Given a document is not time-based
When the file name is generated
Then no date is included in the file name
Download Consistency

Given documents are downloaded individually or as a ZIP
When the files are saved locally
Then the same naming convention is preserved
